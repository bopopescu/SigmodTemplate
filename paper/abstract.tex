Many applications have witnessed the explosive growth of spatial and
spatio-temporal data in recent years, due to the increasing popularity
of smart phones and the rapid development in internet of things (IOT).
As a result, it is critical to provide {\em fast, scalable, and
high-throughput} spatial queries and analytics for numerous
applications in location-base services (LBS). Traditional spatial
databases and spatial analytical engines are disk-based and optimized
for IO efficiency. But increasingly, data is stored and processed in
memory to achieve low latency and CPU time becomes the new bottleneck.

% On the other hand, in-memory computing over a cluster of commodity
% machines becomes increasingly popular as the answer for providing low
% latency, good scalability, and high throughput in different big data
% management domains.

We present the \name (Spatial In-Memory Big data Analytics) system
that offers scalable and efficient in-memory spatial queries and
analytics for big spatial data. \name is based on Spark, and runs over
a cluster of commodity machines. In particular, \name extends and
updates the Spark SQL engine to support rich spatial queries and
analytics through both SQL and DataFrame interfaces. It introduces the
concept and construction of indices over RDDs in order to work with
big spatial data and complex spatial operators. Lastly, \name
implements an effective query optimizer, that leverages its indices
and novel spatial-aware optimizations over RDDs, to achieve both low
latency and high throughput. Extensive experiments over large data
sets demonstrate \name's superior performance compared against other
spatial query and analytical engines.
