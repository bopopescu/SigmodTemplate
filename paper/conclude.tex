\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}
This paper introduces \name, a distributed in-memory spatial query and
analytical engine based on Spark. \name offers simple and expressive
query language in both SQL and DataFrame interfaces. It features low
query latency, high analytics throughput and excellent
scalability. \name extends Spark SQL with native support on a class of
common spatial operations, introduces indexes over RDDs, and adds
spatial-aware logical and cost-based optimizations that makes use of
existing indexes and statistics to select good query plans on the
fly. Extensive experiments conducted on large real data sets show
\name's superior performance against existing distributed spatial
query analytical engines and Spark SQL, and its support for
multidimensional data.

For future work, we plan to add native support on more geometric
objects (e.g., polygons) and additional spatial operators (e.g.,
spatial join over polygons) to \name. Efficient spatial operations on
very high dimensions and other metric spaces still present many
challenges. We also plan to design and implement more sophisticated
CBOs, such as using spatial histograms and kernel density estimate
(KDE), in \name for more effective autotuning.
